## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

When working with thic challenge I encountered, learned and drilled these new concepts (for me):

- **inline SVGs (VS static images)**
- **position: absolute / relative VS translate()**
- **How JavasScript and CSS works together in order to create more interactive and dynamic webpages** 


### Useful resources

- [Inline SVG guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjP0EeV513_b30lhGRTfMbYd) - Kevin Powell's excellent guide on inline SVGs was a great resource helping me grasp this concept fully.
 - [CSS Position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU) - This explaination by Web Dev Simplified on how position works in CSS was a another great resource.


### AI Collaboration

  - I used ChatGPT for debugging and helping me out with explainations on concepts I struggled with (se bullet poiints under "What I leaned" above).
